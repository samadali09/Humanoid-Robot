# simulated_environment.yaml
#
# This file defines a conceptual simulated environment for the Capstone project.
# In a real simulation (e.g., in Isaac Sim), this would typically be a USD file
# or a Gazebo SDF/URDF world description, containing detailed physics, meshes,
# and object properties.
#
# This YAML serves as a high-level representation for LLM planning context
# and basic environment setup for conceptual examples.

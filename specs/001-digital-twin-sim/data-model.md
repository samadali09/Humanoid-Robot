# Data Model: Module 2 – The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

This document outlines the key conceptual entities discussed within the educational module. These are not data models in the traditional software engineering sense (e.g., for a database), but rather the fundamental concepts that learners will engage with in the context of digital twin creation using Gazebo and Unity.

## Conceptual Entities

### Entity: Digital Twin
*   **Description**: A virtual, high-fidelity model that mirrors a physical object, process, or system. In the context of this module, it represents a simulated humanoid robot and its environment, designed for testing and development.
*   **Key Attributes (conceptual)**:
    *   `Physics Simulation`: Handled by Gazebo.
    *   `High-Fidelity Rendering`: Provided by Unity.
    *   `Sensor Data`: Generated by Simulated Sensors.
    *   `Human-Robot Interaction`: Enabled by Unity.
*   **Relationships**: Comprises Gazebo, Unity, Humanoid Robot Model, and Simulated Sensors.

### Entity: Gazebo
*   **Description**: A powerful open-source 3D robot simulator that provides a robust physics engine, generates realistic sensor data, and offers a flexible platform for testing robotics algorithms and robot designs.
*   **Key Attributes (conceptual)**:
    *   `Physics Engine`: Component handling gravity, collisions, and dynamics.
    *   `Robot Models`: Definition of robots (e.g., URDF/SDF).
    *   `World Models`: Definition of the simulation environment.
    *   `Plugins`: Extensions for custom functionality, including sensor simulation.
*   **Relationships**: Provides the Physics Engine for the Digital Twin; can integrate with Unity for rendering.

### Entity: Unity
*   **Description**: A cross-platform real-time 3D development platform used in this module for its advanced capabilities in high-fidelity rendering, creating interactive environments, and facilitating human-robot interaction within the digital twin.
*   **Key Attributes (conceptual)**:
    *   `Rendering Engine`: Responsible for visual fidelity.
    *   `Game Objects`: Fundamental building blocks (e.g., robot parts, environment elements).
    *   `Scripts`: C# code for behavior and interaction.
    *   `Physics Engine (internal)`: Unity's own physics engine, separate from Gazebo's for co-simulation.
*   **Relationships**: Provides high-fidelity visualization and interaction for the Digital Twin; can be integrated with Gazebo.

### Entity: Humanoid Robot Model
*   **Description**: The virtual representation of a humanoid robot within the simulation environments (Gazebo and Unity). This model defines the robot's physical structure, visual appearance, and dynamic properties.
*   **Key Attributes (conceptual)**:
    *   `Links`: Rigid bodies forming the robot's structure.
    *   `Joints`: Connections between links, allowing movement.
    *   `Mass & Inertia`: Physical properties influencing dynamics.
    *   `Collision Geometry`: Defines how the robot interacts physically.
    *   `Visual Geometry`: Defines how the robot appears.
*   **Relationships**: Part of the Digital Twin; loaded and simulated by Gazebo; rendered and interacted with in Unity.

### Entity: Simulated Sensors
*   **Description**: Virtual sensors (e.g., LiDAR, Depth Camera, IMU) integrated into the digital twin to provide realistic environmental and robot state data. These sensors mimic the behavior of their real-world counterparts.
*   **Key Attributes (conceptual)**:
    *   `Type`: LiDAR, Depth Camera, IMU, etc.
    *   `Parameters`: Field of view, range, noise models, update rate.
    *   `Output Data`: Point clouds, depth images, acceleration, angular velocity.
*   **Relationships**: Provide critical data input for the Digital Twin; configured within Gazebo or Unity.

### Entity: Physics Engine
*   **Description**: The core component within Gazebo responsible for accurately simulating physical interactions. This includes forces like gravity, contact dynamics (collisions), and the movement of rigid bodies and joints.
*   **Key Attributes (conceptual)**:
    *   `Gravity`: Environmental force.
    *   `Collision Detection`: Algorithms to find contacts between objects.
    *   `Contact Resolution`: How objects react to collisions.
    *   `Joint Dynamics`: Movement and forces at robot joints.
*   **Relationships**: A fundamental component of Gazebo, which in turn is a part of the Digital Twin.

# API Contracts for Module 4 – Vision-Language-Action (VLA) & Capstone

This module is an educational content module focused on teaching Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robotics, including voice-to-action with OpenAI Whisper, LLM cognitive planning, and a Capstone project. It does not involve the development of a software system with traditional APIs (e.g., RESTful services, GraphQL endpoints) that would require OpenAPI or GraphQL schemas.

Therefore, the generation of API contracts is not applicable to this feature. The "user actions" are learning activities, and the "endpoints" are the conceptual understanding and practical application derived from the module's content and examples.

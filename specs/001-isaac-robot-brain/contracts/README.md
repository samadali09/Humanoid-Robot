# API Contracts for Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

This module is an educational content module focused on teaching advanced perception, synthetic data generation, and path planning for bipedal humanoid movement using NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, and Nav2. It does not involve the development of a software system with traditional APIs (e.g., RESTful services, GraphQL endpoints) that would require OpenAPI or GraphQL schemas.

Therefore, the generation of API contracts is not applicable to this feature. The "user actions" are learning activities, and the "endpoints" are the conceptual understanding and practical application derived from the module's content and examples.
